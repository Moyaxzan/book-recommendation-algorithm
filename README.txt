# Quick start
You need to make sure you downloaded all the packages (main.py, part1.py, part2.py, part3.py) and have a folder called
"Resources" filled with the files we provide or not if you want to start from scratch.
In case you choose your own .txt files, you have to enter "reset_rating" in menu_part3().

Then, to execute the program, you must run the "main.py" file.


# Usage
You just need to follow the steps given by the terminal. When it is asked to input values, write them and press Enter.
Anytime, if you write "back", you will go back a step.
If you write "exit",  you will shut down the program and exit it.
